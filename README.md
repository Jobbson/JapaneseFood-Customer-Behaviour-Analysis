#  Customer Behaviour Analysis 📊💼




 I conducted a comprehensive  Customer Behaviour Analysis using  Microsoft Excel and mySQL, tackling the problem statement below.

### Problem Statement
Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money they’ve spent and also which menu items are their favourite. Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalised experience for his loyal customers.

He plans on using these insights to help him decide whether he should expand the existing customer loyalty program - additionally he needs help to generate some basic datasets so his team can easily inspect the data without needing to use SQL.

Danny has provided you with a sample of his overall customer data due to privacy issues - but he hopes that these examples are enough for you to write fully functioning SQL queries to help him answer his questions!

Danny has shared with you 3 key datasets for this case study:

- sales
- menu
- members


## Key Questions:

🔍 What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?

🔍How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?

🔍What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?

🔍What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?

🔍Which item was the most popular for each customer?

🔍Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?

🔍Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?

🔍What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?

🔍If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier - how many points would each customer have?

🔍In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi - how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?


## Insights 💼: 
- Customer B is the most frequent visitor with 6 visits in Jan 2021.
- Danny’s Diner’s most popular item is ramen, followed by curry and sushi.
- Customer A loves ramen, Customer C loves only ramen whereas Customer B seems to enjoy sushi, curry and ramen equally.
- The last item ordered by Customers A and B before they became members are sushi and curry. It likely mean both of these items are the deciding factor
