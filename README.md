PORTFOLIOCase Study #1 - Danny's DinerPersonal Project ; Tools -MYSQL

Danny wants to use the data to answer a few
simple questions about his customers,
especially about their visiting patterns, how
much money they’ve spent and also which
menu items are their favourite. Having this
deeper connection with his customers will
help him deliver a better and more
personalised experience for his loyal
customers.
He plans on using these insights to help him
decide whether he should expand the existing
customer loyalty program - additionally he
needs help to generate some basic datasets so
his team can easily inspect the data without
needing to use SQL.

ramen, followed by curry and sushi.
- Customer A loves ramen, Customer C
loves only ramen whereas Customer B
seems to enjoy sushi, curry and ramen
equally.

sushi and curry. It likely mean both of
these items are the deciding factor
